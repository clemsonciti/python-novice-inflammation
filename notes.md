## Lesson overview:

Two tasks:
    1. Read, analyze and visualize some data
    2. For each data file, figure out if
    you have any duplicates

Part 1: read file, compute statistics, make plots
Part 2 (capstone): for each file, we're given a function
that returns the number of zero rows, we come
up with the algorithm for this function.
And then we debug the function
